**Manabot** is an open source Discord bot built to assist in running and managing MMORPG-based guilds and online communities. It acts as a digital guild officer, helping organize members, streamline onboarding, and automate common community workflows so leadership can focus on what matters most.

Manabot is written in **C# using Discord.Net**, powered by **MongoDB**, and designed for extensibility and long-term operation. For guilds that prefer convenience, a **hosted public version** is available, removing the need for self-hosting.
